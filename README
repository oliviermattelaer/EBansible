RUNNING THE SCRIPT
==================

step 1-4 can be skip, to update the version of foss (those have to be done only once).

1) create a inventory with all the machine to consider (put all machine inside easybuild group)
2) run:
   $> ansible-playbook -i INVENTORY setup.yml
3) MANUAL: create the symbolic link with the name of the machine that are missing
   $> cd /CECI/soft/cecisw/
   $> ln -s RedHat-6_16-8-1_Infiniband RedHat_6_MagnyCours_Infiniband
4) create a new inventory with one machine for each type of cpu. 
   from the information in ~soft/inventory.db [created in step 2]
   $> mv INVENTORY ./INVENTORY.bk
   $> ./create_inventory.py ~soft/inventory.db INVENTORY
5) run 
   $> ansible-playbook -i INVENTORY site.yml
   Note that for RPM creation, the script need to install rvm which will be discover only in a new shell.
   So in case of crash related to gem/fpm please disconnect/reconnect and retry.
6) MANUAL: VALIDATION
7) MANUAL: change (or create the symbolic link) default to the latest foss version

Note: 
The file ~soft/inventory.db is cumulative (machine previously added are kept in the next run)

TODO LIST
=========
1) installation occurs in default directory should be done in the foss specific one 

HMEM SPECIFIC PROBLEM
=====================
1) hmem18 and hmem19 does not have infiniband (that's fine) but consequently does not mount the /CECI/soft/cecisw/ path

SOLUTION: 
  remove hmem18 and hmem19 from the initial inventory.
